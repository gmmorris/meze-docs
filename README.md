# Meze



Meze, a word with its roots in antiquity, describes a selection of small dishes served accompanying alcoholic drinks, whose purpose is three-fold: to complement and enhance the taste of the drink, to provide the backdrop for a social gathering and to decouple the implementation of the individual dishes so that they may be consumed by the hungry developer in whichever way suits them the best.

The above is as true for real life Meze as for it's Javascript counterpart.
