# Componentisation

Several months ago I gave a talk at one of our fortnightly **Unruly Tech Talks** about a topic that I had been mulling around in my head for several months prior.
The topic was an abstract thought process about an architecture abstraction, triggered by my adoption of the *React* library as a go-to for declarative construction of my user interfaces.

I've been using *React* for a couple of years now, following many years of evangelising *Backbone* as a solution to the problems my clients and employers had been facing when tackling their Front End architectures. As a relatively early adopter of Backbone, in early 2011, I found the move from a messy soup of global Javascript objects with complex prototypical hierarchies, to a structured MVC (or rather, MVP) pattern an extremely welcome step forward.

But while I found the step up to Backbone an enjoyable one, somethings still felt slightly painful, and it wasn't until recently that I could quite put into words the source of this pain.
